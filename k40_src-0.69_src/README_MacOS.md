# Requirements

* Python 3
* inkex (inkscape python dependencies) 
* installation of libraries in requirements.txt

## Instructions:
Ok so, we're going to try this without brew, which should be completely feasable, though if you have brew installed, the instructions may be similar. 

# MacOS get pip
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
# Install pip
python3 get-pip.py




### Install Python & Libraries


__Install requirements:__

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

__Run K40Whisperer__
