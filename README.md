# k40Mod
 I did not write this in large part, main credit goes to scorch works. See <br>
 https://www.scorchworks.com

I've tried providing updates to requests in k40 whisperer source, but my mods never get pushed to main.
OK, Here are the things I will be changing:

Stop listing hidden directories.<br>
provide a shell or remote interface. <br>
Add additional navigational buttons.<br>
Fix the Linux installation instructions<br>

The way K40_whisperer is currently written, with tkinter, is such that only dank hacks really work. 
My interest is mainly in adding functionality, and not rewriting the whole system to properly 
facilitate missing functions. 

This sofware is provided without warrenty, for educational purposes only.
